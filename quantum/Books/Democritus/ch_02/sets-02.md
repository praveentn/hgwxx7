# Sets -02

* axioms and formal logic cannot be used to place arithmetic on a more secure foundation

* premise 1: for all x, if A(x) is true, then B(x) is true
* premise 2: there exists an x such that A(x) is true
* conclusion: there exists an x such that B(x) is true

  - deriving the conclusion from the premises is purely a syntactic operation

## Axioms of Set Theory | Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms

The foundation for basically all of math.

* Empty set
  - a set x for which there is no y such that y ∈ x

* Extensionality
  - for all x and y, if (z ∈ x iff z ∈ y for all z), then x = y
  - two sets contain same elements, then the sets are equal

* Pairing
* Union
* Existence of infinite sets
* Power set
* Replacement
* Foundation
