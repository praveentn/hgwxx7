## Sets

* Empty sets

* first-order logic
  - and, or, not
  - equals sign
  - parentheses
  - variables
  - predicates
  - quantifiers
    - there exists
    - for all

* rules of first-order logic
  - propositional tautologies
    - A or not A
    - not(A and not A)
  - modus ponens
    - if A is valid and A implies B, then B is valid
  - equality rules
    - x=x
    - x=y implies y=x
    - x=y and y=z implies x=z
    - x=y implies f(x)=f(y)
  - change of variables
    - changing variable names leaves a statement valid
  - quantifier elimination
    - if for all x, A(x) is valid, then A(y) is valid for any y
  - quantifier addition
    - if A(y) is valid where y is an unrestricted variable, then for all x, A(x) is valid
  - quantifier rules
    - if not(for all x, A(x)) is valid, then there exists an x such that not(A(x)) is valid

* Peano Axioms for the Non-negative integers
  - Zero exists
    - there exists a z such that for all x, S(x) is not equal to z (z taken to be 0)

  - every integer has at most one predecessor
    - for all x, y, if S(x) = S(y) then x=y
