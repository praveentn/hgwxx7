## Quantum bits

	- mathematical objects with certain properties
		○ gives the freedom to construct a general theory of QC&QI
		○ does not depend on a specific system for its realization
	- can be realized as physical objects like classical bits

### Dirac notation
	- standard notation for states

0 and 1 are the states of a classical system
Qubits can be in states other than 0 and 1

### Realizing qubits
	- two different polarizations of a photon
	- alignment of a nuclear spin in a uniform magnetic field
	- two states of an electron orbiting a single atom
		○ ground or excited states

Changing the states of an electron by shining light on the atom, with appropriate energy for an appropriate length of time
	- 0 to 1
	- 1 to 0

But by reducing the time we shine the light, an electron in 0 state can be moved to |+> state; halfway between 0 and 1
	- + state


### Bloch sphere
	- useful means for visualizing the state of a single qubit

No simple generalization of the Bloch sphere known for multiple qubits

### Quantum information
	- how can one quantify information, if we cannot measure it?
  - in the state of a qubit, nature conceals a great deal of hidden information
  
QM - a powerful tool for Information Processing!
