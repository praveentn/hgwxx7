FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS


### Introduction and overview

- Quantum computation & quantum information is the study of the information processing tasks that can be accomplished using Quantum mechanical systems

- For example, online security, artificial intelligence, drug discovery, weather forecasting, traffic control, climate change predictions etc.

### Beginning of Quantum Mechanics

- What is QM? 
	- A mathematical framework for the construction of physical theories!

- QED 
	- example of physical theory which describes the interactions of atoms and light, accurately
	- QED is built up within the framework of QM

- No-cloning theorem
	- one of the earliest results of QC&QI

- Superconductivity
	- explained by QM

- The ability to control single quantum systems is essential to harness the power of QM

### Classical computers vs. Quantum computers

- Church-Turing thesis
	- Any algorithmic process can be simulated efficiently using a Turing machine

	- (Movie about the life of Alan Turing, The Imitation Game)

- Soloway-Strassen test
	- Determinism to randomness and certainty
	- Any algorithmic process can be simulated efficiently using a probabilistic Turing machine


- Deutsch's Universal Quantum computer

- Peter Shor
	- finding prime factors of an integer
	- discrete logarithm problem

<i>"Quantum computers are more powerful than Turing machines"</i>

- Lov Grover
	- sped up search across unstructured space

- Building computers based on the principles of QM ~ Richard Feynman

- Future application
	- performing simulations of QM systems 


- What class of problems can be solves efficiently on a quantum computer, and how does that class compare to the class of problems that can be solved efficiently on a classical computer?


- Shannon's theorems (quantifying information)
	- noiseless channel coding theorem
		○ Quantifies the physical resources required to store the output from an information source
	- noisy channel coding theorem
		○ Quantifies how much information it's possible to reliably transmit through a noisy communication channel
	
- error-correcting codes
